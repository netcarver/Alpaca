h1. Alpaca -- A Textile System Implemented in PHP

*Alpaca is currently a work-in-progress, I don't even consider it alpha software yet.*

You're welcome to clone it, and even submit pull requests, but it will be changing so don't rely on it for anything.

h2. Goals

Alpaca aims to...

# extend Textile from its 'text to HTML' origins by separating the textile _parser_ from the _output generator_
# encourage Textile to develop as a lightweight abstract markup standard, not just as a 'text to HTML' converter
# allow for extensions to the basic textile standard via a plugin mechanism
