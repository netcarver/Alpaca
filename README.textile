h1. Alpaca -- A Flexible Textile Parser Implemented in PHP

h2. Goals

Alpaca aims to...

# extend Textile from its 'text to HTML' origins by separating the textile _parser_ from the _output generator_
# encourage Textile to develop as a lightweight abstract markup standard, not just as a 'text to HTML' converter
# allow for extensions to the basic textile standard via a plugin mechanism called 'fleeces'

...whilst providing support for generation of the following output formats...

* HTML (the default)
* Markdown
